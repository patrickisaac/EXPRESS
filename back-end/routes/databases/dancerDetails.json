    "bio": "Andrew is a graduate student in the Interdisciplinary Oncology program at the University of British Columbia with a passion for dance. His dance training started formally in 2014 during a year-long exchange program at UC San Diego where he joined the collegiate team “Ascension”. After that, Andrew began training at Culture Shock Dance Center and upon his return to Vancouver, started training at Studio604 and Harbor Dance Center. Since then, Andrew has taught informal drop-ins at the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, Douglas College and UC San Diego. In 2017, Andrew established a team at the University of British Columbia called “Candies”, which is primarily a training and showcase team. During the regular season they invite well respected dancers from across Vancouver to train in choreography as well as various street styles. As a group primarily composed of students who do not aim to be professional dancers, Andrew believes that the best use of their dancing ability is to give back to the community. Therefore, Candies hosts workshops throughout the year and perform at various events that serve as charity fundraisers.",
    "quote": "Andrew believes that it doesn’t take much to become a recreational dancer as long as people enjoy moving to music and creating new friendships through it.",

He is now a local Vancouver choreographer as well as the Director of Epiphany all while teaching weekly at Studio604. He has gone through different styles in movement; ranging from street jazz/contemporary to mainly hip-hop/urban style. He loves to fuse old school throwbacks with modern day groove. He strives to share his knowledge and learn from others and their creativity in the dance community.",
    "quote": "It takes a lot of time, energy and mindset as an individual to become a dancer and more towards it if you plan to pursue it as a long-term career. Connecting with other dancers in the community helps expand your knowledge and experience. Learning and dancing with the right people who have the same mindset you aim for helps, however it all starts with your physical and mental attributes.",

Marquis has been grinding ever since! Performing at shows, doing showcases, competing at international and local competitions, and teaching locally at various studios! Though dance brought him through some unforgettable experiences, he will always think of himself as a student, learning and growing with like-minded individuals who live and love this art!",

    "bio": "Larissa Simpson started dancing at PraiseTEAM Studios at age 14. Her first hip hop teacher was Paul Otterbein, who was an incredible mentor at the start of her dance journey. Her passion for dance led her and her two friends Joy and Mario to create Epiphany Workshops, weekly free dance classes at Fraser Heights Recreation centre, allowing aspiring choreographers a chance to have experience teaching. At 16, she was chosen for Sr. Select, a group created by Menelaine Valencia, and was exposed to locking and breakdancing. Later that year she made it into PraiseTEAM’s Sr. Showcase and made the cut, training under director Missy Reyes. Since then, she has participated in many competitions locally and internationally, including World of Dance Vancouver, Artists Emerge, Maxt Out and World Hip Hop Dance Championships, winning bronze in 2011 and silver in 2013 with PraiseTEAM’s Sr. Showcase. While in PraiseTEAM, Larissa took classes in contemporary, tap, waacking and hip hop. Larissa taught at PraiseTEAM from 2010-2014, teaching hip hop to teens and primary school aged children. In 2013, Larissa Joy and Mario founded the Epiphany large group at Studio 604, a dance crew dedicated to providing opportunities for dancers to push themselves to their potential best. She also taught an after school dance program in spring 2014 through Do What U Luv Foundation, in light of Surrey School District’s recent arts and creative education budget cut. Larissa taught at Street Kings Academy from 2015-2017, teaching competitive hip hop to groups, solos, and duos.  In past years Larissa has danced in projects for The Main Event, of Vancouver’s best talent showcases.  Larissa just recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, so when she is not working, she is trying to expand her dance knowledge by taking classes in as many dance styles and choreographers as she can, as well as continue to work towards developing her personal style.",

I attended Sullivan Heights Secondary School (Surrey BC) where I started dancing in Grade 11 when my friends forced me to audition for the Hip Hop Team. As a music lover, I dance purely as a stress-reliever and to vibe out with others. I especially enjoy hip hop, house, and dance hall. I’ve danced alongside Unity Dance Co. as well as UHHU Crew. I have experience dancing in different venues and performing at shows such as Midnight Mondays,and Fever After Dark. I aspire to teach others the beauty in dance and complete my studies in Dental Hygiene.",
    "quote": "For myself, I see dance serving two main purposes: as a craft/artform, as well as a form of communication. Dance is a beautiful craft that takes long hours of practice, hard-work and concentration. It’s also a way to express yourself and communicate with others without verbally speaking. On that note, being able to see that is the key of being a dancer. It’s so much more than just learning a few eight counts, it’s about sharing the space and energy with those around you in the studio. Furthermore, it’s important to be versatile, self-motivated, and to have an outgoing personality with the willingness to always learn. Dance has endless opportunities and gives you the ability to connect with a local and global community.",
